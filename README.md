## Project Description

**99Bottles** is a beer-focused webapp that is designed to be a resource for people interested in learning
more about beer, in all it's many forms and styles. The basic functionality is to allow users to select a
style of beer, and have the app return information about that style (description, ABV range, IBU range) and
a visual gallery of all the beers that fall under the selected style.

The user can then click on each beer card to get more information about that beer (description, brewery, ABV,
IBU, Organic).

### Future Goals ###

Search feature for specific beers, returning detailed information on that beer.

Section focused on breweries (information, location, menus, etc.)

Recommendation engine that allows a user to select a beer they like and get recommendations for other beers
they might like.
